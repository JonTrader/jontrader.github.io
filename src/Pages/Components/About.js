                                        I am an aspiring Web Developer and Software Engineer with a great passion for computers, coding and technology in general. 
                                        I have experience in Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React. I'm currently learning advanced Java Programming Language, CSS and 
                                        different libraries within CSS such as Bootstrap 4. I also aspire to learn advanced JavaScript, React and much more. 
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        I took a while to transition into Computer Science. I transferred from some Engineerings to others and finally decided to study Computer Science. 
                                        After my first coding class I found a huge desire to keep learning, which allowed me to finally decide to choose Computer Science as my major.

                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        Other than my passion for coding and programming, I also find passion in Photography and Sports (mainly Soccer). I consider myself a 
                                        great problem-solver, an excellent peer that is able to work in teams, a great individual that is also able to work alone and have the patience and adaptibility 
                                        to be able to work in any environment.
